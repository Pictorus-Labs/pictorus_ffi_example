# Lib

This directory contains the shared static library and header file needed to link against the exported Pictorus app. The static library is named `libpictorus.a` and the header file is named `pictorus.h`. Normally when you export an application as a static/dynamic library, the library file will have a unique name based on the app it originated from. It has been renamed here to `libpictorus.a` for simplicity.
